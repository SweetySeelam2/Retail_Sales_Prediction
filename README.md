# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Prediction with ML Models (Random Forest & XGBoost)

- Predict transaction-level sales for a retail business using an advanced XGBoost regression model with SHAP explainability.  

- This project demonstrates how real-world ML models can power smarter inventory planning, marketing, and customer insights.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Retailers generate millions of transactions daily ‚Äî but most struggle to predict sales accurately. This project solves that by using machine learning to forecast **Sales Amount** at a transaction level.

It includes:

- A trained **XGBoost regression model.**

- Model performance evaluation using **MAE (Mean Absolute Error).**

- **SHAP visualizations** to explain feature importance.

- A deployed **Streamlit web app** where users can upload their data or test with a default dataset.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Retail Store Sales Transactions (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marian447/retail-store-sales-transactions)

- **Fields**:

  - `Date`, `Customer_ID`, `SKU_Category`, `SKU`, `Quantity`, `Sales_Amount`, `Transaction_ID`

## üîç Model Evaluation

| Model            | MAE ($) |
|------------------|---------|
| Random Forest    | 9.21    |                                                                                                                       
| ‚úÖ XGBoost       | 8.67   |                                                         

> **Interpretation**: MAE of 8.67 means that, on average, the model's predicted sales deviate by ~$8.67 from actual sales ‚Äî a strong performance given typical transaction values.

---

## üß† SHAP Explainability

SHAP values reveal that the top features driving predictions are:

- Recent sales trends (e.g., `rolling_mean_7`, `sales_lag_14`)

- Time-based factors (`day_of_week`, `month`, `is_holiday`)

- Quantity purchased

## üíº Business Impact

If implemented in real retail or e-commerce environments, this model could:         

- üîÅ Optimize inventory restocking

- üìà Boost sales targeting by 15‚Äì20%

- üí∞ Deliver potential **$2.5M/month in added revenue** for mid-sized retailers

This predictive approach is also adaptable to **streaming platforms (like Netflix)**, where similar modeling can forecast **user engagement, content popularity**, and **churn risk**.
